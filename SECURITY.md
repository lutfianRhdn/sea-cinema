Please note that only vulnerabilities previously unknown to us are eligible for public credit.

## Security Best Practices

We encourage all users and contributors to follow these security best practices:

- Keep your dependencies and libraries up to date.
- Implement secure coding practices and follow industry-standard guidelines.
- Regularly review and audit your codebase for vulnerabilities.
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your GitHub account.
- Be cautious of third-party libraries and ensure they come from reputable sources.
